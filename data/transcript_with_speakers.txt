[00:00:00-00:00:18] Technician: The reason that took so long is that I just kind of also built all your equipment options
[00:00:18-00:00:19] Technician: and I was out there too.
[00:00:19-00:00:20] Customer: Okay, sure.
[00:00:20-00:00:23] Technician: I'd love to wrap up with you here.
[00:00:23-00:00:24] Customer: Of course.
[00:00:24-00:00:25] Customer: Of course.
[00:00:25-00:00:28] Technician: So what are you up to for the rest of the day?
[00:00:28-00:00:35] Customer: I literally can't work from anywhere else but your home.
[00:00:35-00:00:36] Customer: I know.
[00:00:36-00:00:37] Customer: I know.
[00:00:37-00:00:38] Customer: Right.
[00:00:38-00:00:39] Customer: Yeah, my job is really crazy.
[00:00:39-00:00:40] Customer: I work more.
[00:00:40-00:00:57] Technician: Yeah, AI is a big thing, man, but so just to let's go right to just the differences
[00:00:57-00:01:05] Technician: here, I just wanted to show you, so remember before, we had that below freezing temperature
[00:01:05-00:01:14] Technician: at 41, it's good to see, and then we had that 20 degree difference, so you've got a road
[00:01:15-00:01:24] Technician: there for you, and gosh, you have a good shape.
[00:01:24-00:01:33] Technician: So when it comes to just what to expect here in the future, I would say a month or two
[00:01:33-00:01:38] Technician: months, I think we'll start to see, or even sooner, we'll start to see the efficiency
[00:01:38-00:01:39] Technician: drop.
[00:01:39-00:01:45] Technician: And we still have those mold issues.
[00:01:45-00:01:48] Technician: I did just want to show you some different equipment options.
[00:01:48-00:01:49] Technician: Of course.
[00:01:49-00:01:50] Technician: Oh my goodness.
[00:01:50-00:01:51] Technician: Who is this?
[00:01:51-00:01:54] Technician: Yeah, this is Michelangelo.
[00:01:54-00:01:55] Technician: Michelangelo?
[00:01:55-00:01:56] Customer: Hello.
[00:01:56-00:01:57] Technician: What's up?
[00:01:57-00:01:58] Technician: I love cats.
[00:01:58-00:01:59] Technician: Get out of here.
[00:01:59-00:02:00] Technician: Aw.
[00:02:00-00:02:08] Technician: I have two cats and three dogs at home, so we have quite the chaos household.
[00:02:08-00:02:15] Technician: So two equipment options, or there's a total of four that I built.
[00:02:15-00:02:24] Technician: There's either we replace like for like, which will naturally be more efficient, even though
[00:02:24-00:02:27] Technician: it's just going to be the updated version of what you have.
[00:02:27-00:02:34] Customer: It's going to be a new furnace, new coil, new condenser, higher serating, better efficiency,
[00:02:34-00:02:39] Technician: but still like the same type of equipment.
[00:02:39-00:02:48] Technician: The next step beyond that is maintaining gas heating, electric cooling, but upgrading
[00:02:48-00:02:49] Technician: efficiency.
[00:02:49-00:02:54] Technician: And the interesting thing about that is that actually ended up being the most expensive
[00:02:54-00:02:56] Technician: one of the four that I built.
[00:02:56-00:02:59] Technician: Are you familiar with natural gas phase outs?
[00:02:59-00:03:00] Technician: No.
[00:03:00-00:03:01] Technician: I haven't had one.
[00:03:01-00:03:02] Customer: Okay.
[00:03:02-00:03:09] Technician: Let's say, for instance, we have tub stove tops being phased out, we do have gas water
[00:03:09-00:03:14] Technician: heaters being phased out, we have gas furnaces being phased out.
[00:03:14-00:03:17] Technician: Are you familiar with what California's gold is?
[00:03:17-00:03:18] Technician: Yeah.
[00:03:18-00:03:19] Technician: Some of that.
[00:03:19-00:03:20] Technician: Yeah.
[00:03:20-00:03:21] Technician: I like the idea.
[00:03:21-00:03:22] Technician: It's just kind of a lot.
[00:03:22-00:03:25] Technician: They want every house to have a 200 amp panel.
[00:03:25-00:03:28] Technician: They want every house to have a gas jet generator.
[00:03:28-00:03:30] Technician: They want every house to have solar.
[00:03:30-00:03:33] Technician: And they want every house to have a heat pump.
[00:03:33-00:03:37] Technician: And so heat pumps are the next option.
[00:03:37-00:03:41] Technician: Heat pumps are actually just got introduced some more rebates.
[00:03:41-00:03:47] Technician: So even though those are the best possible system to install, weirdly enough, those actually
[00:03:47-00:03:50] Technician: are getting quite affordable at the moment.
[00:03:50-00:03:56] Technician: I'm used to them being actually our most expensive option, but rebates have been introduced that
[00:03:56-00:03:58] Technician: have made it a lot more reasonable.
[00:03:58-00:03:59] Technician: Interesting.
[00:03:59-00:04:08] Technician: And when it comes to the two different heating options, I just have two different types of
[00:04:08-00:04:10] Technician: heat pumps that I'm building for you.
[00:04:10-00:04:11] Technician: Okay.
[00:04:11-00:04:12] Customer: So let's just look at-
[00:04:12-00:04:13] Technician: So light to light, higher efficiency.
[00:04:13-00:04:15] Technician: And then two different types of heat pumps.
[00:04:15-00:04:18] Customer: It's the same technology and then two heat pumps.
[00:04:18-00:04:19] Customer: Exactly.
[00:04:19-00:04:26] Technician: And so to start off with, it's always important to realize that these are more expensive than
[00:04:26-00:04:28] Technician: investments than your normal investment into a home.
[00:04:28-00:04:32] Customer: So I just wanted you to understand that a lot of our clients do use different monthly
[00:04:32-00:04:33] Technician: options to take care of them.
[00:04:33-00:04:35] Technician: But let's just break down what we do.
[00:04:35-00:04:37] Technician: So let's start off with the light for light.
[00:04:37-00:04:40] Customer: We always come with our guarantees.
[00:04:40-00:04:45] Customer: We have some really, really excellent guarantees that really just show you that we're going
[00:04:45-00:04:47] Technician: to do a great job for you.
[00:04:47-00:04:49] Technician: We then start off with our first cost.
[00:04:49-00:04:53] Technician: This is a newest Nest thermostat.
[00:04:53-00:04:55] Technician: We can switch this up.
[00:04:55-00:04:59] Technician: I just wanted to just simplify it, put something in that you guys are used to.
[00:04:59-00:05:02] Technician: It will be just the most modern version.
[00:05:02-00:05:07] Technician: And then we credit this back towards replacement at the very end.
[00:05:07-00:05:11] Technician: So this 549 will be credited back towards you.
[00:05:11-00:05:17] Technician: Then we talk about like steps like what we need to do, AC removal, hallway and disposal,
[00:05:17-00:05:19] Technician: heater and removal.
[00:05:19-00:05:21] Technician: This is a really lengthy section.
[00:05:21-00:05:27] Technician: This is like typically roughly one day, this amount of work.
[00:05:27-00:05:34] Technician: We remove, safely demolish and dispose of your furnace.
[00:05:34-00:05:41] Technician: Remove, safely remove the refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your AC.
[00:05:41-00:05:45] Technician: And that's a pretty lengthy section.
[00:05:45-00:05:50] Technician: This next one may or may not come up, but I am including it as a line item.
[00:05:50-00:05:52] Customer: Just in case it becomes relevant.
[00:05:52-00:05:59] Technician: Sometimes when we have water damage, I do see decayed plywood in sections.
[00:05:59-00:06:02] Technician: Where there could be mold growth or anything like that.
[00:06:02-00:06:07] Technician: If we're seeing anything like that, we just cut that plywood out and put new plywood in.
[00:06:07-00:06:09] Technician: That's in the inside.
[00:06:09-00:06:14] Technician: Next, the new system is not going to be the same dimensions.
[00:06:14-00:06:21] Technician: It's going to be a little bit smaller or a little bit wider, a little bit taller or something around there.
[00:06:21-00:06:26] Technician: And we do have to make sure the sheet metal connections fit to it.
[00:06:26-00:06:29] Technician: We do any sheet metal necessary.
[00:06:29-00:06:32] Customer: Outside we have a fuse box.
[00:06:32-00:06:35] Technician: That's where I remove it and work on it safely.
[00:06:35-00:06:37] Technician: We just put a new one in for you.
[00:06:37-00:06:40] Technician: All the new electrical, there will be some new electrical in there.
[00:06:40-00:06:43] Customer: Currently there's a little on off switch in there called a safety shut off.
[00:06:43-00:06:45] Technician: We always come with a new one.
[00:06:45-00:06:52] Technician: Any new thermostat wiring or connections, any new electrical whips, we install that for you.
[00:06:52-00:06:55] Technician: We have circuit breakers.
[00:06:55-00:07:00] Technician: On the AC we just prefer to have a brand new circuit breaker, so we just include that with it.
[00:07:00-00:07:10] Technician: Thermostat wire, communication wire, this just means if there is a need to rerun a thermostat wire, we absolutely would.
[00:07:10-00:07:14] Technician: And then HVAC permanent, we always pull permits.
[00:07:14-00:07:19] Technician: There is a caveat for permit.
[00:07:19-00:07:26] Technician: Pulling, usually they like to do a hers test as well. Have you heard of that before?
[00:07:26-00:07:29] Technician: No, I don't know what a hers test is.
[00:07:29-00:07:30] Technician: Is it like an efficiency test?
[00:07:30-00:07:32] Technician: It's a home efficiency test.
[00:07:32-00:07:39] Technician: And I do know right now your home would not pass a hers test because of the condition of the ducting.
[00:07:39-00:07:43] Technician: And a little bit of your installation too.
[00:07:43-00:07:52] Technician: So we love to do hers tests, but in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would need to do a little bit with your ducting.
[00:07:52-00:07:55] Technician: Or consider modifying it.
[00:07:55-00:08:00] Technician: What that would look like is something we do have a promotion going on currently.
[00:08:00-00:08:04] Customer: It's sealing your duct work, which means no replacement.
[00:08:04-00:08:09] Technician: But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly.
[00:08:09-00:08:12] Technician: And then we can include a hers test if we do that.
[00:08:12-00:08:16] Technician: Next, this is the total cost of 4D discounts.
[00:08:16-00:08:19] Customer: I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included.
[00:08:19-00:08:21] Technician: This is again the like for like option.
[00:08:21-00:08:27] Technician: And just to explain what it comes with, I explained R410A, the refrigerant got phased out.
[00:08:27-00:08:30] Technician: We have the newest style here, R32.
[00:08:30-00:08:35] Technician: This is basically just the new standard for refrigerant.
[00:08:35-00:08:38] Technician: It is considered to be better for the environment.
[00:08:38-00:08:41] Technician: It's just much less harmful to ozone layers.
[00:08:41-00:08:46] Technician: In general, 35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings.
[00:08:46-00:08:49] Technician: It is going to be the same similar type of technology.
[00:08:49-00:08:51] Technician: The sear rating is up.
[00:08:51-00:08:53] Technician: You currently have a 12 sear.
[00:08:53-00:08:55] Customer: We install a 15.
[00:08:55-00:08:59] Technician: And then we always include standard filtration for you as basic.
[00:08:59-00:09:02] Technician: The motor is an improvement.
[00:09:02-00:09:05] Technician: So the fan motor inside of the system is an improvement.
[00:09:05-00:09:08] Technician: Way more reliable and way quieter.
[00:09:08-00:09:10] Technician: That's basically what this comes with.
[00:09:10-00:09:15] Technician: Now, a really cool thing, 10-year manufacturer warranty, 10-year compressor warranties.
[00:09:15-00:09:22] Technician: If you're on this maintenance program with us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties.
[00:09:22-00:09:26] Technician: It's essentially 10-year parts and 10-year manufacturer warranty.
[00:09:26-00:09:31] Technician: And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump.
[00:09:31-00:09:34] Technician: Really very similar line items.
[00:09:34-00:09:36] Technician: I'm not going to go through every single one this time.
[00:09:36-00:09:38] Technician: I wanted to pause at this one though.
[00:09:38-00:09:44] Technician: The technology we're talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter.
[00:09:44-00:09:46] Technician: Have you ever heard of an inverter before?
[00:09:46-00:09:47] Technician: Actually, you know what?
[00:09:47-00:09:49] Technician: I saw your mini-split.
[00:09:49-00:09:55] Technician: It actually mimics that technology, but in a ducted sense.
[00:09:55-00:09:58] Technician: That's a ductless heating and cooling system.
[00:09:58-00:10:04] Technician: This one, we have that same type of inverter technology where it ramps up and ramps down,
[00:10:04-00:10:07] Technician: except for just attaching it to the ductwork.
[00:10:07-00:10:13] Customer: So the main difference here is important to realize that it's going to heat and cool a little bit differently.
[00:10:13-00:10:16] Technician: In general, everything is going to be an improvement.
[00:10:16-00:10:19] Technician: Cooling will be significantly better.
[00:10:19-00:10:23] Technician: Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill savings.
[00:10:23-00:10:29] Technician: The thing about the heating side, it's just important to note,
[00:10:29-00:10:33] Technician: usually they don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do.
[00:10:33-00:10:38] Technician: Old furnaces have flames, so obviously we're going to get really intense temperature coming out.
[00:10:38-00:10:44] Technician: These do heat a little bit less extreme, but still are totally capable of...
[00:10:44-00:10:46] Technician: You know about these.
[00:10:46-00:10:47] Technician: Perfect.
[00:10:47-00:10:53] Technician: Everything else is the same, AC removal, hallways, pistols, heat removal, plywood, circuit breaker, thermostat, permit.
[00:10:53-00:10:59] Technician: And there's the price before any discounts or rebates.
[00:10:59-00:11:06] Technician: We then have our discounts and rebates, which I realize I didn't include on the other option here.
[00:11:06-00:11:17] Technician: But starting off, this existed on your other estimate too, is $1,800 off because we're able to reuse the copper line set.
[00:11:17-00:11:20] Technician: Very resilient to time and corrosion.
[00:11:20-00:11:28] Technician: If my install crew does determine that your HVAC leak that you have right now is in your copper line,
[00:11:28-00:11:30] Technician: we just still take care of it.
[00:11:30-00:11:33] Technician: But even with this savings in place.
[00:11:33-00:11:38] Technician: Next, we have the thermostat credit back towards you, and this where we have some rebates.
[00:11:38-00:11:44] Technician: So Silicon Valley Clean Energy, I did just want to confirm, did you opt out of this program?
[00:11:44-00:11:46] Technician: You would have to manually opt out of it.
[00:11:46-00:11:47] Technician: Yeah, I didn't opt out.
[00:11:47-00:11:48] Technician: Okay, so you're good.
[00:11:48-00:11:54] Technician: So Silicon Valley Clean Energy is a $2,500 off towards heat pump updates.
[00:11:54-00:12:01] Technician: Next, we have Tech, which is one that just barely got reintroduced like yesterday.
[00:12:01-00:12:05] Customer: So that's really cool that it got introduced.
[00:12:05-00:12:12] Technician: And $1,500 off here, what this is, is the fact that we're removing both a furnace and AC,
[00:12:12-00:12:15] Technician: qualifies you for this higher end one.
[00:12:15-00:12:18] Technician: So we handle what we need to handle.
[00:12:18-00:12:21] Customer: There are things that you need to physically go in and do.
[00:12:21-00:12:30] Technician: The only one for the SVCE is you do, and well, this will be in a contract that you can just click on easily.
[00:12:30-00:12:37] Technician: You do need to submit a full PG&E bill, like every page off a PG&E bill.
[00:12:37-00:12:40] Technician: And then we do the rest.
[00:12:40-00:12:48] Technician: What they need from us is proof that we've installed a inverter system and the manufacturer label.
[00:12:48-00:12:50] Technician: So can we take care of that?
[00:12:50-00:12:55] Technician: For Tech, let's see.
[00:12:55-00:12:57] Technician: I think we just take care of this one for you.
[00:12:57-00:13:02] Technician: Oh, you know what? This one does require a HERS test to be done.
[00:13:02-00:13:07] Customer: So for this area, I would love to include one of our promotions for you,
[00:13:07-00:13:11] Technician: which is where we just include a duct seal.
[00:13:11-00:13:14] Technician: And that would be something I can definitely do.
[00:13:14-00:13:17] Technician: So if that passes a HERS test, I think you're all good.
[00:13:17-00:13:22] Technician: Clear record with the C.
[00:13:22-00:13:28] Customer: Yeah, as long as you have no failed permits, then it should pass.
[00:13:28-00:13:29] Technician: Failed permits, meaning?
[00:13:29-00:13:33] Technician: Like you tried to pull a permit and it didn't work or pass inspection.
[00:13:33-00:13:34] Technician: I see.
[00:13:34-00:13:35] Technician: I see.
[00:13:35-00:13:36] Technician: So for these...
[00:13:36-00:13:37] Technician: For your homework.
[00:13:37-00:13:38] Technician: Because there was something.
[00:13:38-00:13:39] Technician: Okay, no problem.
[00:13:39-00:13:41] Technician: So it looks like you would qualify for this.
[00:13:41-00:13:44] Technician: The next option will go to...
[00:13:44-00:13:45] Technician: And what was that option?
[00:13:45-00:13:46] Technician: Oh, total price?
[00:13:46-00:13:49] Customer: No, no, what was that option that you showed me? A heat pump.
[00:13:49-00:13:50] Technician: Yep.
[00:13:50-00:13:55] Technician: So you can actually see what's kind of funny is it's relatively around the same price as it is again.
[00:13:55-00:13:58] Technician: And actually a little bit less expensive, weirdly.
[00:13:58-00:14:02] Technician: And what's really cool, I was actually talking to Alex that I was really impressed.
[00:14:02-00:14:08] Technician: I just built your best possible heat pump.
[00:14:08-00:14:10] Technician: This is like our branded unit.
[00:14:10-00:14:11] Technician: It's a dyken.
[00:14:11-00:14:15] Technician: Dyken we love to work with because they really like us.
[00:14:15-00:14:21] Technician: And if you ever look up dyken products on Google and you look up install videos, you'll
[00:14:21-00:14:28] Technician: actually see my company installing them because we do the worldwide training for how to install
[00:14:28-00:14:29] Technician: dyken.
[00:14:29-00:14:32] Customer: So we just have a great partnership with them, so we like to install them.
[00:14:32-00:14:42] Customer: But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology.
[00:14:42-00:14:49] Technician: Heat pumps on occasion enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and
[00:14:49-00:14:53] Customer: it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up.
[00:14:53-00:14:56] Technician: These are known to not really enter that.
[00:14:56-00:15:02] Technician: And it's just because of the way the coils are built.
[00:15:02-00:15:08] Technician: They have a better type of metal derivative in it than is better at dissipating its own
[00:15:08-00:15:11] Customer: heat and keeping it self-warm.
[00:15:11-00:15:16] Technician: The only time he's ever entered defrost, which we won't ever get to here in California, is
[00:15:16-00:15:18] Technician: when they enter 18 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:15:18-00:15:20] Technician: So it just won't happen.
[00:15:20-00:15:21] Technician: And it's just really funny.
[00:15:21-00:15:26] Technician: If we look at the really high-end furnace, it's just like we really climb the cost.
[00:15:26-00:15:27] Technician: I can see that.
[00:15:27-00:15:28] Technician: It's substantial.
[00:15:28-00:15:31] Technician: None of these options moving the unit to the top?
[00:15:31-00:15:33] Technician: Currently, I haven't built that.
[00:15:33-00:15:36] Technician: We do have an attic package.
[00:15:36-00:15:39] Technician: I would actually have to modify these estimates to do that.
[00:15:39-00:15:42] Technician: The reason I'm starting like this, I just wanted you to understand what it would look
[00:15:42-00:15:44] Technician: like to keep it in the closet.
[00:15:44-00:15:50] Technician: So when it comes to keeping it in the closet, we are completely fine moving it to your attic.
[00:15:50-00:15:52] Technician: Completely fine.
[00:15:52-00:16:02] Technician: The thing I like to make sure my clients understand is serviceability, maintenance, and efficiency.
[00:16:02-00:16:03] Technician: That is the best location.
[00:16:03-00:16:05] Technician: Yeah, because it's too hard up there.
[00:16:05-00:16:07] Technician: What about moving it to the garage?
[00:16:07-00:16:09] Technician: That would be way harder.
[00:16:09-00:16:10] Technician: Harder?
[00:16:10-00:16:11] Technician: Harder.
[00:16:11-00:16:12] Technician: Harder.
[00:16:12-00:16:13] Technician: So much more work.
[00:16:13-00:16:17] Customer: We would actually be forced to replace your ductwork entirely.
[00:16:17-00:16:18] Technician: Okay.
[00:16:18-00:16:25] Technician: And with this, the benefit of moving it up to the attic though, is you do get a full closet.
[00:16:25-00:16:32] Technician: In general, it is a pretty, in regards to air flow that enters the home, it's a pretty nice spot.
[00:16:32-00:16:38] Technician: It's just we do have to do some modifications to just explain your attic install.
[00:16:38-00:16:43] Technician: That intake will no longer be used.
[00:16:43-00:16:47] Technician: We would add one probably close to the center of the house.
[00:16:47-00:16:54] Technician: And our systems are very quiet, but it is just something that we will have air flow here now.
[00:16:54-00:16:57] Technician: And then we would have to run some new electrical.
[00:16:57-00:17:01] Technician: If we're not doing a new gas line, that's great.
[00:17:01-00:17:10] Technician: But we do have to install, we would have to install the intake here.
[00:17:10-00:17:17] Technician: And yeah, closet systems in regards to what the system itself likes is the best location.
[00:17:17-00:17:20] Technician: But at the end of the day, the systems are built for you.
[00:17:20-00:17:23] Customer: So if we're moving it to the attic, it would be fine.
[00:17:23-00:17:26] Technician: I kind of forget at the top of my head how much it adds to the project.
[00:17:26-00:17:32] Technician: It is, depending on the severity of necessary, if you think of adding at least 4,000 to it.
[00:17:32-00:17:36] Technician: But on the highest end, it would involve a new ductwork.
[00:17:36-00:17:41] Technician: And then we add a fair amount to it.
[00:17:41-00:17:42] Technician: Okay, okay.
[00:17:42-00:17:44] Technician: Yeah, but we don't like that.
[00:17:44-00:17:46] Technician: It's not so much the cabinet is denoised.
[00:17:46-00:17:48] Technician: Oh, it's way quieter.
[00:17:48-00:17:50] Technician: Any of our units install.
[00:17:50-00:17:52] Technician: That way it would be better.
[00:17:53-00:18:02] Technician: And what I can even do as an extra way to make that noise even better is it would swap the grill.
[00:18:02-00:18:05] Technician: So the grill right now has louvers, right?
[00:18:05-00:18:10] Technician: So when an airflow is pulled in and it does this, that naturally creates noise.
[00:18:10-00:18:16] Technician: We can install an egg carton version that has squares instead.
[00:18:16-00:18:19] Technician: It's much, much, much better for airflow.
[00:18:19-00:18:22] Technician: And when that happens, it makes it a lot quieter.
[00:18:22-00:18:28] Technician: I did do a test one time on no change other than the grill.
[00:18:28-00:18:31] Technician: And it decreased noise by 20% after that.
[00:18:31-00:18:35] Technician: So 20% quieter.
[00:18:35-00:18:43] Technician: It would still get on the noise, not, it would be much less noisy than this.
[00:18:43-00:18:50] Technician: But if we did do the basic furnace, that's not going to be as quiet.
[00:18:50-00:18:56] Technician: But if we talk about inverters, those actually can sometimes be even on.
[00:18:56-00:18:59] Technician: He doesn't do even here running around.
[00:18:59-00:19:01] Customer: Okay, that makes sense.
[00:19:01-00:19:04] Technician: I can hear it with this.
[00:19:04-00:19:09] Technician: Yeah, that technology gets introduced here.
[00:19:09-00:19:16] Technician: All that to say, if there's an incredible cooling domain, it still will pull a lot of air flow.
[00:19:16-00:19:19] Technician: But that won't happen that consistently.
[00:19:19-00:19:26] Technician: It would happen when it breaks 100 or when it's 105, then it might be, it'll still be quieter than that.
[00:19:26-00:19:30] Technician: But it will get to like equivalent air pressure when it crosses itself.
[00:19:30-00:19:31] Technician: Okay, okay.
[00:19:31-00:19:35] Technician: All right, so the options I have are, can I see the prices again?
[00:19:35-00:19:38] Technician: So all of these are going to be great options for you.
[00:19:38-00:19:42] Technician: I do have to take this call.
[00:19:42-00:19:43] Technician: Feel free to review this.
[00:19:43-00:19:58] Technician: Okay, I'm still talking to our client here about their options.
[00:19:58-00:20:21] Technician: I see that all these are, this one went to the side.
[00:20:21-00:20:27] Technician: Yes, that's a big difference too, is amount of room taken up outside.
[00:20:27-00:20:29] Technician: These are going to be taller systems.
[00:20:29-00:20:31] Technician: So it is actually, you know what?
[00:20:31-00:20:36] Technician: It'll be really, really close to the same height, but they're like this thin.
[00:20:36-00:20:38] Technician: But they go wide though.
[00:20:38-00:20:44] Technician: Yeah, but my experience with other ones is that it vents to the side so it's kind of windy.
[00:20:44-00:20:46] Technician: It still will.
[00:20:46-00:20:50] Customer: And what I like about this one is that it vents to the top.
[00:20:50-00:20:55] Technician: I can build a form of inverter that does do that.
[00:20:55-00:20:56] Technician: Yeah.
[00:20:56-00:21:02] Technician: So they have these units that vents upwards?
[00:21:02-00:21:09] Technician: Yep, the brand is Bosch, very highly reviewed, mostly actually highly reviewed from technicians,
[00:21:09-00:21:11] Technician: which is very cool.
[00:21:11-00:21:14] Technician: Technicians love working on them because they're very reliable.
[00:21:14-00:21:21] Technician: But I don't know where the Bosch would end up, but I do think it would be roughly in that same area.
[00:21:21-00:21:27] Technician: The only thing we can find out with Bosch in a second, but you see how this says energy star, high heat?
[00:21:27-00:21:35] Technician: Whenever you see energy star, that actually can qualify you for one further rebate that you have to deal with completely on your own.
[00:21:35-00:21:37] Technician: We can't help you.
[00:21:37-00:21:40] Technician: It's a tax cut rebate.
[00:21:40-00:21:45] Technician: And usually, if you qualify for it, it's either $1,000 or $2,000.
[00:21:45-00:21:49] Technician: If we don't have energy star on it, you can't have that rebate.
[00:21:49-00:21:50] Technician: And Bosch doesn't have that.
[00:21:50-00:21:53] Technician: Okay, got it.
[00:21:53-00:21:55] Technician: Want me to just find out real quick?
[00:21:55-00:21:57] Technician: Sure.
[00:21:57-00:22:00] Technician: Let me just modify this estimate to be a Bosch.
[00:22:00-00:22:01] Technician: But leave that one there.
[00:22:01-00:22:04] Technician: I'm just going to duplicate it and we'll switch it over to a Bosch.
[00:22:20-00:22:33] Technician: Okay, it does have energy star on it.
[00:22:33-00:22:44] Technician: So the difference is this one will have, it won't have the high heat feature.
[00:22:44-00:23:03] Technician: So let me just get where did I put the estimate this way.
[00:23:03-00:23:05] Technician: There we go.
[00:23:33-00:23:50] Technician: So now we have, that's funny they all end up being in the same price range.
[00:23:50-00:24:02] Technician: So it's, again, in regards to technology, the only thing that the Brian has over the other ones is that it doesn't enter defrost as often in California that we really don't enter defrost.
[00:24:02-00:24:05] Technician: I had a heat pump before and another place never had a problem with it.
[00:24:05-00:24:07] Customer: It was like more than 20 years ago.
[00:24:07-00:24:08] Technician: And it was here in California?
[00:24:08-00:24:09] Technician: Yeah.
[00:24:09-00:24:14] Customer: So I think it's just, it will just very rarely enter a defrost cycle.
[00:24:14-00:24:17] Customer: But this one just has that better feature.
[00:24:17-00:24:18] Technician: Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:18-00:24:19] Technician: Yeah.
[00:24:19-00:24:20] Technician: Okay.
[00:24:20-00:24:21] Customer: Okay.
[00:24:21-00:24:23] Technician: And how long does it take to install the system?
[00:24:23-00:24:29] Technician: If we are doing a heat pump, it's going to be roughly two or three days.
[00:24:29-00:24:32] Technician: Because there is a lot of work that goes into a heat pump.
