[00:00:00-00:00:18] The reason that took so long is that I just kind of also built all your equipment options
[00:00:18-00:00:19] and I was out there too.
[00:00:19-00:00:20] Okay, sure.
[00:00:20-00:00:23] I'd love to wrap up with you here.
[00:00:23-00:00:24] Of course.
[00:00:24-00:00:25] Of course.
[00:00:25-00:00:28] So what are you up to for the rest of the day?
[00:00:28-00:00:35] I literally can't work from anywhere else but your home.
[00:00:35-00:00:36] I know.
[00:00:36-00:00:37] I know.
[00:00:37-00:00:38] Right.
[00:00:38-00:00:39] Yeah, my job is really crazy.
[00:00:39-00:00:40] I work more.
[00:00:40-00:00:57] Yeah, AI is a big thing, man, but so just to let's go right to just the differences
[00:00:57-00:01:05] here, I just wanted to show you, so remember before, we had that below freezing temperature
[00:01:05-00:01:14] at 41, it's good to see, and then we had that 20 degree difference, so you've got a road
[00:01:15-00:01:24] there for you, and gosh, you have a good shape.
[00:01:24-00:01:33] So when it comes to just what to expect here in the future, I would say a month or two
[00:01:33-00:01:38] months, I think we'll start to see, or even sooner, we'll start to see the efficiency
[00:01:38-00:01:39] drop.
[00:01:39-00:01:45] And we still have those mold issues.
[00:01:45-00:01:48] I did just want to show you some different equipment options.
[00:01:48-00:01:49] Of course.
[00:01:49-00:01:50] Oh my goodness.
[00:01:50-00:01:51] Who is this?
[00:01:51-00:01:54] Yeah, this is Michelangelo.
[00:01:54-00:01:55] Michelangelo?
[00:01:55-00:01:56] Hello.
[00:01:56-00:01:57] What's up?
[00:01:57-00:01:58] I love cats.
[00:01:58-00:01:59] Get out of here.
[00:01:59-00:02:00] Aw.
[00:02:00-00:02:08] I have two cats and three dogs at home, so we have quite the chaos household.
[00:02:08-00:02:15] So two equipment options, or there's a total of four that I built.
[00:02:15-00:02:24] There's either we replace like for like, which will naturally be more efficient, even though
[00:02:24-00:02:27] it's just going to be the updated version of what you have.
[00:02:27-00:02:34] It's going to be a new furnace, new coil, new condenser, higher serating, better efficiency,
[00:02:34-00:02:39] but still like the same type of equipment.
[00:02:39-00:02:48] The next step beyond that is maintaining gas heating, electric cooling, but upgrading
[00:02:48-00:02:49] efficiency.
[00:02:49-00:02:54] And the interesting thing about that is that actually ended up being the most expensive
[00:02:54-00:02:56] one of the four that I built.
[00:02:56-00:02:59] Are you familiar with natural gas phase outs?
[00:02:59-00:03:00] No.
[00:03:00-00:03:01] I haven't had one.
[00:03:01-00:03:02] Okay.
[00:03:02-00:03:09] Let's say, for instance, we have tub stove tops being phased out, we do have gas water
[00:03:09-00:03:14] heaters being phased out, we have gas furnaces being phased out.
[00:03:14-00:03:17] Are you familiar with what California's gold is?
[00:03:17-00:03:18] Yeah.
[00:03:18-00:03:19] Some of that.
[00:03:19-00:03:20] Yeah.
[00:03:20-00:03:21] I like the idea.
[00:03:21-00:03:22] It's just kind of a lot.
[00:03:22-00:03:25] They want every house to have a 200 amp panel.
[00:03:25-00:03:28] They want every house to have a gas jet generator.
[00:03:28-00:03:30] They want every house to have solar.
[00:03:30-00:03:33] And they want every house to have a heat pump.
[00:03:33-00:03:37] And so heat pumps are the next option.
[00:03:37-00:03:41] Heat pumps are actually just got introduced some more rebates.
[00:03:41-00:03:47] So even though those are the best possible system to install, weirdly enough, those actually
[00:03:47-00:03:50] are getting quite affordable at the moment.
[00:03:50-00:03:56] I'm used to them being actually our most expensive option, but rebates have been introduced that
[00:03:56-00:03:58] have made it a lot more reasonable.
[00:03:58-00:03:59] Interesting.
[00:03:59-00:04:08] And when it comes to the two different heating options, I just have two different types of
[00:04:08-00:04:10] heat pumps that I'm building for you.
[00:04:10-00:04:11] Okay.
[00:04:11-00:04:12] So let's just look at-
[00:04:12-00:04:13] So light to light, higher efficiency.
[00:04:13-00:04:15] And then two different types of heat pumps.
[00:04:15-00:04:18] It's the same technology and then two heat pumps.
[00:04:18-00:04:19] Exactly.
[00:04:19-00:04:26] And so to start off with, it's always important to realize that these are more expensive than
[00:04:26-00:04:28] investments than your normal investment into a home.
[00:04:28-00:04:32] So I just wanted you to understand that a lot of our clients do use different monthly
[00:04:32-00:04:33] options to take care of them.
[00:04:33-00:04:35] But let's just break down what we do.
[00:04:35-00:04:37] So let's start off with the light for light.
[00:04:37-00:04:40] We always come with our guarantees.
[00:04:40-00:04:45] We have some really, really excellent guarantees that really just show you that we're going
[00:04:45-00:04:47] to do a great job for you.
[00:04:47-00:04:49] We then start off with our first cost.
[00:04:49-00:04:53] This is a newest Nest thermostat.
[00:04:53-00:04:55] We can switch this up.
[00:04:55-00:04:59] I just wanted to just simplify it, put something in that you guys are used to.
[00:04:59-00:05:02] It will be just the most modern version.
[00:05:02-00:05:07] And then we credit this back towards replacement at the very end.
[00:05:07-00:05:11] So this 549 will be credited back towards you.
[00:05:11-00:05:17] Then we talk about like steps like what we need to do, AC removal, hallway and disposal,
[00:05:17-00:05:19] heater and removal.
[00:05:19-00:05:21] This is a really lengthy section.
[00:05:21-00:05:27] This is like typically roughly one day, this amount of work.
[00:05:27-00:05:34] We remove, safely demolish and dispose of your furnace.
[00:05:34-00:05:41] Remove, safely remove the refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your AC.
[00:05:41-00:05:45] And that's a pretty lengthy section.
[00:05:45-00:05:50] This next one may or may not come up, but I am including it as a line item.
[00:05:50-00:05:52] Just in case it becomes relevant.
[00:05:52-00:05:59] Sometimes when we have water damage, I do see decayed plywood in sections.
[00:05:59-00:06:02] Where there could be mold growth or anything like that.
[00:06:02-00:06:07] If we're seeing anything like that, we just cut that plywood out and put new plywood in.
[00:06:07-00:06:09] That's in the inside.
[00:06:09-00:06:14] Next, the new system is not going to be the same dimensions.
[00:06:14-00:06:21] It's going to be a little bit smaller or a little bit wider, a little bit taller or something around there.
[00:06:21-00:06:26] And we do have to make sure the sheet metal connections fit to it.
[00:06:26-00:06:29] We do any sheet metal necessary.
[00:06:29-00:06:32] Outside we have a fuse box.
[00:06:32-00:06:35] That's where I remove it and work on it safely.
[00:06:35-00:06:37] We just put a new one in for you.
[00:06:37-00:06:40] All the new electrical, there will be some new electrical in there.
[00:06:40-00:06:43] Currently there's a little on off switch in there called a safety shut off.
[00:06:43-00:06:45] We always come with a new one.
[00:06:45-00:06:52] Any new thermostat wiring or connections, any new electrical whips, we install that for you.
[00:06:52-00:06:55] We have circuit breakers.
[00:06:55-00:07:00] On the AC we just prefer to have a brand new circuit breaker, so we just include that with it.
[00:07:00-00:07:10] Thermostat wire, communication wire, this just means if there is a need to rerun a thermostat wire, we absolutely would.
[00:07:10-00:07:14] And then HVAC permanent, we always pull permits.
[00:07:14-00:07:19] There is a caveat for permit.
[00:07:19-00:07:26] Pulling, usually they like to do a hers test as well. Have you heard of that before?
[00:07:26-00:07:29] No, I don't know what a hers test is.
[00:07:29-00:07:30] Is it like an efficiency test?
[00:07:30-00:07:32] It's a home efficiency test.
[00:07:32-00:07:39] And I do know right now your home would not pass a hers test because of the condition of the ducting.
[00:07:39-00:07:43] And a little bit of your installation too.
[00:07:43-00:07:52] So we love to do hers tests, but in order for us to feel confident in doing that, we would need to do a little bit with your ducting.
[00:07:52-00:07:55] Or consider modifying it.
[00:07:55-00:08:00] What that would look like is something we do have a promotion going on currently.
[00:08:00-00:08:04] It's sealing your duct work, which means no replacement.
[00:08:04-00:08:09] But we go to every single connection and seal it thoroughly.
[00:08:09-00:08:12] And then we can include a hers test if we do that.
[00:08:12-00:08:16] Next, this is the total cost of 4D discounts.
[00:08:16-00:08:19] I do have a fair amount of discounts that I've included.
[00:08:19-00:08:21] This is again the like for like option.
[00:08:21-00:08:27] And just to explain what it comes with, I explained R410A, the refrigerant got phased out.
[00:08:27-00:08:30] We have the newest style here, R32.
[00:08:30-00:08:35] This is basically just the new standard for refrigerant.
[00:08:35-00:08:38] It is considered to be better for the environment.
[00:08:38-00:08:41] It's just much less harmful to ozone layers.
[00:08:41-00:08:46] In general, 35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings.
[00:08:46-00:08:49] It is going to be the same similar type of technology.
[00:08:49-00:08:51] The sear rating is up.
[00:08:51-00:08:53] You currently have a 12 sear.
[00:08:53-00:08:55] We install a 15.
[00:08:55-00:08:59] And then we always include standard filtration for you as basic.
[00:08:59-00:09:02] The motor is an improvement.
[00:09:02-00:09:05] So the fan motor inside of the system is an improvement.
[00:09:05-00:09:08] Way more reliable and way quieter.
[00:09:08-00:09:10] That's basically what this comes with.
[00:09:10-00:09:15] Now, a really cool thing, 10-year manufacturer warranty, 10-year compressor warranties.
[00:09:15-00:09:22] If you're on this maintenance program with us, we actually completely match the manufacturer warranties.
[00:09:22-00:09:26] It's essentially 10-year parts and 10-year manufacturer warranty.
[00:09:26-00:09:31] And then moving on, we'll just get to the first heat pump.
[00:09:31-00:09:34] Really very similar line items.
[00:09:34-00:09:36] I'm not going to go through every single one this time.
[00:09:36-00:09:38] I wanted to pause at this one though.
[00:09:38-00:09:44] The technology we're talking about with this heat pump is called an inverter.
[00:09:44-00:09:46] Have you ever heard of an inverter before?
[00:09:46-00:09:47] Actually, you know what?
[00:09:47-00:09:49] I saw your mini-split.
[00:09:49-00:09:55] It actually mimics that technology, but in a ducted sense.
[00:09:55-00:09:58] That's a ductless heating and cooling system.
[00:09:58-00:10:04] This one, we have that same type of inverter technology where it ramps up and ramps down,
[00:10:04-00:10:07] except for just attaching it to the ductwork.
[00:10:07-00:10:13] So the main difference here is important to realize that it's going to heat and cool a little bit differently.
[00:10:13-00:10:16] In general, everything is going to be an improvement.
[00:10:16-00:10:19] Cooling will be significantly better.
[00:10:19-00:10:23] Usually we're talking like 60% utility bill savings.
[00:10:23-00:10:29] The thing about the heating side, it's just important to note,
[00:10:29-00:10:33] usually they don't absolutely kill it the same way old furnaces do.
[00:10:33-00:10:38] Old furnaces have flames, so obviously we're going to get really intense temperature coming out.
[00:10:38-00:10:44] These do heat a little bit less extreme, but still are totally capable of...
[00:10:44-00:10:46] You know about these.
[00:10:46-00:10:47] Perfect.
[00:10:47-00:10:53] Everything else is the same, AC removal, hallways, pistols, heat removal, plywood, circuit breaker, thermostat, permit.
[00:10:53-00:10:59] And there's the price before any discounts or rebates.
[00:10:59-00:11:06] We then have our discounts and rebates, which I realize I didn't include on the other option here.
[00:11:06-00:11:17] But starting off, this existed on your other estimate too, is $1,800 off because we're able to reuse the copper line set.
[00:11:17-00:11:20] Very resilient to time and corrosion.
[00:11:20-00:11:28] If my install crew does determine that your HVAC leak that you have right now is in your copper line,
[00:11:28-00:11:30] we just still take care of it.
[00:11:30-00:11:33] But even with this savings in place.
[00:11:33-00:11:38] Next, we have the thermostat credit back towards you, and this where we have some rebates.
[00:11:38-00:11:44] So Silicon Valley Clean Energy, I did just want to confirm, did you opt out of this program?
[00:11:44-00:11:46] You would have to manually opt out of it.
[00:11:46-00:11:47] Yeah, I didn't opt out.
[00:11:47-00:11:48] Okay, so you're good.
[00:11:48-00:11:54] So Silicon Valley Clean Energy is a $2,500 off towards heat pump updates.
[00:11:54-00:12:01] Next, we have Tech, which is one that just barely got reintroduced like yesterday.
[00:12:01-00:12:05] So that's really cool that it got introduced.
[00:12:05-00:12:12] And $1,500 off here, what this is, is the fact that we're removing both a furnace and AC,
[00:12:12-00:12:15] qualifies you for this higher end one.
[00:12:15-00:12:18] So we handle what we need to handle.
[00:12:18-00:12:21] There are things that you need to physically go in and do.
[00:12:21-00:12:30] The only one for the SVCE is you do, and well, this will be in a contract that you can just click on easily.
[00:12:30-00:12:37] You do need to submit a full PG&E bill, like every page off a PG&E bill.
[00:12:37-00:12:40] And then we do the rest.
[00:12:40-00:12:48] What they need from us is proof that we've installed a inverter system and the manufacturer label.
[00:12:48-00:12:50] So can we take care of that?
[00:12:50-00:12:55] For Tech, let's see.
[00:12:55-00:12:57] I think we just take care of this one for you.
[00:12:57-00:13:02] Oh, you know what? This one does require a HERS test to be done.
[00:13:02-00:13:07] So for this area, I would love to include one of our promotions for you,
[00:13:07-00:13:11] which is where we just include a duct seal.
[00:13:11-00:13:14] And that would be something I can definitely do.
[00:13:14-00:13:17] So if that passes a HERS test, I think you're all good.
[00:13:17-00:13:22] Clear record with the C.
[00:13:22-00:13:28] Yeah, as long as you have no failed permits, then it should pass.
[00:13:28-00:13:29] Failed permits, meaning?
[00:13:29-00:13:33] Like you tried to pull a permit and it didn't work or pass inspection.
[00:13:33-00:13:34] I see.
[00:13:34-00:13:35] I see.
[00:13:35-00:13:36] So for these...
[00:13:36-00:13:37] For your homework.
[00:13:37-00:13:38] Because there was something.
[00:13:38-00:13:39] Okay, no problem.
[00:13:39-00:13:41] So it looks like you would qualify for this.
[00:13:41-00:13:44] The next option will go to...
[00:13:44-00:13:45] And what was that option?
[00:13:45-00:13:46] Oh, total price?
[00:13:46-00:13:49] No, no, what was that option that you showed me? A heat pump.
[00:13:49-00:13:50] Yep.
[00:13:50-00:13:55] So you can actually see what's kind of funny is it's relatively around the same price as it is again.
[00:13:55-00:13:58] And actually a little bit less expensive, weirdly.
[00:13:58-00:14:02] And what's really cool, I was actually talking to Alex that I was really impressed.
[00:14:02-00:14:08] I just built your best possible heat pump.
[00:14:08-00:14:10] This is like our branded unit.
[00:14:10-00:14:11] It's a dyken.
[00:14:11-00:14:15] Dyken we love to work with because they really like us.
[00:14:15-00:14:21] And if you ever look up dyken products on Google and you look up install videos, you'll
[00:14:21-00:14:28] actually see my company installing them because we do the worldwide training for how to install
[00:14:28-00:14:29] dyken.
[00:14:29-00:14:32] So we just have a great partnership with them, so we like to install them.
[00:14:32-00:14:42] But what's interesting is Bryant does have a corner on a type of technology.
[00:14:42-00:14:49] Heat pumps on occasion enter a defrost cycle, which is where it briefly stops heating and
[00:14:49-00:14:53] it just runs itself alone to heat itself back up.
[00:14:53-00:14:56] These are known to not really enter that.
[00:14:56-00:15:02] And it's just because of the way the coils are built.
[00:15:02-00:15:08] They have a better type of metal derivative in it than is better at dissipating its own
[00:15:08-00:15:11] heat and keeping it self-warm.
[00:15:11-00:15:16] The only time he's ever entered defrost, which we won't ever get to here in California, is
[00:15:16-00:15:18] when they enter 18 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:15:18-00:15:20] So it just won't happen.
[00:15:20-00:15:21] And it's just really funny.
[00:15:21-00:15:26] If we look at the really high-end furnace, it's just like we really climb the cost.
[00:15:26-00:15:27] I can see that.
[00:15:27-00:15:28] It's substantial.
[00:15:28-00:15:31] None of these options moving the unit to the top?
[00:15:31-00:15:33] Currently, I haven't built that.
[00:15:33-00:15:36] We do have an attic package.
[00:15:36-00:15:39] I would actually have to modify these estimates to do that.
[00:15:39-00:15:42] The reason I'm starting like this, I just wanted you to understand what it would look
[00:15:42-00:15:44] like to keep it in the closet.
[00:15:44-00:15:50] So when it comes to keeping it in the closet, we are completely fine moving it to your attic.
[00:15:50-00:15:52] Completely fine.
[00:15:52-00:16:02] The thing I like to make sure my clients understand is serviceability, maintenance, and efficiency.
[00:16:02-00:16:03] That is the best location.
[00:16:03-00:16:05] Yeah, because it's too hard up there.
[00:16:05-00:16:07] What about moving it to the garage?
[00:16:07-00:16:09] That would be way harder.
[00:16:09-00:16:10] Harder?
[00:16:10-00:16:11] Harder.
[00:16:11-00:16:12] Harder.
[00:16:12-00:16:13] So much more work.
[00:16:13-00:16:17] We would actually be forced to replace your ductwork entirely.
[00:16:17-00:16:18] Okay.
[00:16:18-00:16:25] And with this, the benefit of moving it up to the attic though, is you do get a full closet.
[00:16:25-00:16:32] In general, it is a pretty, in regards to air flow that enters the home, it's a pretty nice spot.
[00:16:32-00:16:38] It's just we do have to do some modifications to just explain your attic install.
[00:16:38-00:16:43] That intake will no longer be used.
[00:16:43-00:16:47] We would add one probably close to the center of the house.
[00:16:47-00:16:54] And our systems are very quiet, but it is just something that we will have air flow here now.
[00:16:54-00:16:57] And then we would have to run some new electrical.
[00:16:57-00:17:01] If we're not doing a new gas line, that's great.
[00:17:01-00:17:10] But we do have to install, we would have to install the intake here.
[00:17:10-00:17:17] And yeah, closet systems in regards to what the system itself likes is the best location.
[00:17:17-00:17:20] But at the end of the day, the systems are built for you.
[00:17:20-00:17:23] So if we're moving it to the attic, it would be fine.
[00:17:23-00:17:26] I kind of forget at the top of my head how much it adds to the project.
[00:17:26-00:17:32] It is, depending on the severity of necessary, if you think of adding at least 4,000 to it.
[00:17:32-00:17:36] But on the highest end, it would involve a new ductwork.
[00:17:36-00:17:41] And then we add a fair amount to it.
[00:17:41-00:17:42] Okay, okay.
[00:17:42-00:17:44] Yeah, but we don't like that.
[00:17:44-00:17:46] It's not so much the cabinet is denoised.
[00:17:46-00:17:48] Oh, it's way quieter.
[00:17:48-00:17:50] Any of our units install.
[00:17:50-00:17:52] That way it would be better.
[00:17:53-00:18:02] And what I can even do as an extra way to make that noise even better is it would swap the grill.
[00:18:02-00:18:05] So the grill right now has louvers, right?
[00:18:05-00:18:10] So when an airflow is pulled in and it does this, that naturally creates noise.
[00:18:10-00:18:16] We can install an egg carton version that has squares instead.
[00:18:16-00:18:19] It's much, much, much better for airflow.
[00:18:19-00:18:22] And when that happens, it makes it a lot quieter.
[00:18:22-00:18:28] I did do a test one time on no change other than the grill.
[00:18:28-00:18:31] And it decreased noise by 20% after that.
[00:18:31-00:18:35] So 20% quieter.
[00:18:35-00:18:43] It would still get on the noise, not, it would be much less noisy than this.
[00:18:43-00:18:50] But if we did do the basic furnace, that's not going to be as quiet.
[00:18:50-00:18:56] But if we talk about inverters, those actually can sometimes be even on.
[00:18:56-00:18:59] He doesn't do even here running around.
[00:18:59-00:19:01] Okay, that makes sense.
[00:19:01-00:19:04] I can hear it with this.
[00:19:04-00:19:09] Yeah, that technology gets introduced here.
[00:19:09-00:19:16] All that to say, if there's an incredible cooling domain, it still will pull a lot of air flow.
[00:19:16-00:19:19] But that won't happen that consistently.
[00:19:19-00:19:26] It would happen when it breaks 100 or when it's 105, then it might be, it'll still be quieter than that.
[00:19:26-00:19:30] But it will get to like equivalent air pressure when it crosses itself.
[00:19:30-00:19:31] Okay, okay.
[00:19:31-00:19:35] All right, so the options I have are, can I see the prices again?
[00:19:35-00:19:38] So all of these are going to be great options for you.
[00:19:38-00:19:42] I do have to take this call.
[00:19:42-00:19:43] Feel free to review this.
[00:19:43-00:19:58] Okay, I'm still talking to our client here about their options.
[00:19:58-00:20:21] I see that all these are, this one went to the side.
[00:20:21-00:20:27] Yes, that's a big difference too, is amount of room taken up outside.
[00:20:27-00:20:29] These are going to be taller systems.
[00:20:29-00:20:31] So it is actually, you know what?
[00:20:31-00:20:36] It'll be really, really close to the same height, but they're like this thin.
[00:20:36-00:20:38] But they go wide though.
[00:20:38-00:20:44] Yeah, but my experience with other ones is that it vents to the side so it's kind of windy.
[00:20:44-00:20:46] It still will.
[00:20:46-00:20:50] And what I like about this one is that it vents to the top.
[00:20:50-00:20:55] I can build a form of inverter that does do that.
[00:20:55-00:20:56] Yeah.
[00:20:56-00:21:02] So they have these units that vents upwards?
[00:21:02-00:21:09] Yep, the brand is Bosch, very highly reviewed, mostly actually highly reviewed from technicians,
[00:21:09-00:21:11] which is very cool.
[00:21:11-00:21:14] Technicians love working on them because they're very reliable.
[00:21:14-00:21:21] But I don't know where the Bosch would end up, but I do think it would be roughly in that same area.
[00:21:21-00:21:27] The only thing we can find out with Bosch in a second, but you see how this says energy star, high heat?
[00:21:27-00:21:35] Whenever you see energy star, that actually can qualify you for one further rebate that you have to deal with completely on your own.
[00:21:35-00:21:37] We can't help you.
[00:21:37-00:21:40] It's a tax cut rebate.
[00:21:40-00:21:45] And usually, if you qualify for it, it's either $1,000 or $2,000.
[00:21:45-00:21:49] If we don't have energy star on it, you can't have that rebate.
[00:21:49-00:21:50] And Bosch doesn't have that.
[00:21:50-00:21:53] Okay, got it.
[00:21:53-00:21:55] Want me to just find out real quick?
[00:21:55-00:21:57] Sure.
[00:21:57-00:22:00] Let me just modify this estimate to be a Bosch.
[00:22:00-00:22:01] But leave that one there.
[00:22:01-00:22:04] I'm just going to duplicate it and we'll switch it over to a Bosch.
[00:22:20-00:22:33] Okay, it does have energy star on it.
[00:22:33-00:22:44] So the difference is this one will have, it won't have the high heat feature.
[00:22:44-00:23:03] So let me just get where did I put the estimate this way.
[00:23:03-00:23:05] There we go.
[00:23:33-00:23:50] So now we have, that's funny they all end up being in the same price range.
[00:23:50-00:24:02] So it's, again, in regards to technology, the only thing that the Brian has over the other ones is that it doesn't enter defrost as often in California that we really don't enter defrost.
[00:24:02-00:24:05] I had a heat pump before and another place never had a problem with it.
[00:24:05-00:24:07] It was like more than 20 years ago.
[00:24:07-00:24:08] And it was here in California?
[00:24:08-00:24:09] Yeah.
[00:24:09-00:24:14] So I think it's just, it will just very rarely enter a defrost cycle.
[00:24:14-00:24:17] But this one just has that better feature.
[00:24:17-00:24:18] Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:18-00:24:19] Yeah.
[00:24:19-00:24:20] Okay.
[00:24:20-00:24:21] Okay.
[00:24:21-00:24:23] And how long does it take to install the system?
[00:24:23-00:24:29] If we are doing a heat pump, it's going to be roughly two or three days.
[00:24:29-00:24:32] Because there is a lot of work that goes into a heat pump.
[00:24:32-00:24:38] If it was a gas system to existing AC, I would say one to two days.
[00:24:38-00:24:40] And then there is still a promotion.
[00:24:40-00:24:42] I haven't even included any of these.
[00:24:42-00:24:44] And that would be duct sealing.
[00:24:44-00:24:49] And those, that also can take close to a day too.
[00:24:49-00:24:56] Depending on time frames, we have an install crew or two out here for you.
[00:24:56-00:24:58] If you have two, it really speeds things up.
[00:24:58-00:25:01] So that's either two guys or four guys.
[00:25:01-00:25:02] Okay.
[00:25:02-00:25:03] Okay.
[00:25:03-00:25:05] And all right, I understand the options.
[00:25:05-00:25:06] That's fine.
[00:25:06-00:25:12] I'm not, I would be interested on the heat pump.
[00:25:12-00:25:16] Maybe these two, I'm not interested on the gas.
[00:25:16-00:25:17] Sure.
[00:25:17-00:25:20] And then the other thing I noticed is that you also have financing.
[00:25:20-00:25:21] I do.
[00:25:21-00:25:22] Yeah.
[00:25:22-00:25:23] You go.
[00:25:23-00:25:26] So for financing, can you show me the monthly payment?
[00:25:26-00:25:27] Yeah.
[00:25:27-00:25:30] So we have different options.
[00:25:30-00:25:32] We have, let's go to the Bosch.
[00:25:32-00:25:37] And that's the one that you like the idea of having air flow up.
[00:25:37-00:25:40] We'll look at financing.
[00:25:40-00:25:46] So we'll look at when time offers July.
[00:25:46-00:25:49] So these are just all of our options that we have.
[00:25:49-00:25:54] So we have an 120 month, 8.99 interest with AutoPed.
[00:25:54-00:25:56] So you don't have to do anything.
[00:25:56-00:26:00] 180 so much longer term with 9.99.
[00:26:00-00:26:05] This is our most, these two are our most commonly used.
[00:26:05-00:26:10] Good Leap actually just barely, just gave us access to this this month.
[00:26:10-00:26:12] It was supposed to end on the 15th.
[00:26:12-00:26:14] So I'm surprised it's still going on.
[00:26:14-00:26:23] But the 12 months, no interest just means that if you do pay it off in 12 months.
[00:26:24-00:26:26] You just pay the same as cash.
[00:26:26-00:26:29] Like there's no interest rate or anything.
[00:26:29-00:26:32] This is just a very common one because of the low interest rate.
[00:26:32-00:26:35] And it just goes on for a little bit of a longer term.
[00:26:35-00:26:46] And yeah, I think when it comes to this one that we're seeing.
[00:26:46-00:26:50] When it comes to this payment that we're seeing there.
[00:26:50-00:26:54] That's including the 5.99 one for the 60 months.
[00:26:54-00:26:55] 60 months.
[00:26:55-00:26:57] So five years of 5.99.
[00:26:57-00:27:06] Five years, 3.35 and that, that includes the promotions area.
[00:27:06-00:27:10] Yeah, there's still some line items in regards to promotions I haven't included.
[00:27:10-00:27:15] But this is baseline equipment at the moment.
[00:27:15-00:27:19] And what is the monthly payment with the one that you showed me that I can pay off earlier?
[00:27:19-00:27:22] In a year, that type of one.
[00:27:22-00:27:27] So you don't need to pay anything for a full year if you don't want.
[00:27:27-00:27:33] You actually do have the ability to take a year off of payments entirely.
[00:27:33-00:27:34] But then?
[00:27:34-00:27:38] But then if it goes to that, I think it's not a nasty interest rate.
[00:27:38-00:27:39] It's something around 10%.
[00:27:39-00:27:40] Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:27:40-00:27:44] It's not a horrible, horrible interest rate, but there is an interest rate there.
[00:27:44-00:27:49] Oh, so you basically pay the full amount within the year, then whatever.
[00:27:49-00:27:52] But the nice thing is, is you don't need to pay anything for the year either.
[00:27:52-00:28:07] So if we did pay it off in 12 payments, let's say, it would be a little bit over 2000 a month.
[00:28:07-00:28:09] Because it's within a year.
[00:28:09-00:28:10] Within a year.
[00:28:10-00:28:14] But then I think the terms actually go really, really close.
[00:28:14-00:28:19] It's like five years of, I think 9.99 from there.
[00:28:19-00:28:23] But the nice thing though is let's say you don't pay it off in full.
[00:28:23-00:28:29] Let's say you go to the year and maybe you put 18,000 down.
[00:28:29-00:28:40] So we still have a remaining balance of 84.22.
[00:28:40-00:28:44] What then happens is that interest only applies to that remaining balance.
[00:28:44-00:28:48] So we only get the remaining balance.
[00:28:48-00:28:55] So that would then divide it by, yeah.
[00:28:55-00:28:58] So we just get that remaining.
[00:28:58-00:29:00] And then divide it by 60.
[00:29:00-00:29:03] That would be like your monthly payments.
[00:29:03-00:29:05] For five more years.
[00:29:05-00:29:08] But then you can pay it off early and it's no big deal.
[00:29:08-00:29:09] Of course.
[00:29:09-00:29:10] I get it.
[00:29:10-00:29:16] Okay, so I like to speak with my wife about all the options.
[00:29:16-00:29:18] Email me these.
[00:29:18-00:29:23] And then, of course, let's cover what you did today.
[00:29:23-00:29:25] And then I'll just discuss this with my wife.
[00:29:25-00:29:26] Sure.
[00:29:26-00:29:30] I like the idea of the thing being quieter and more efficient.
[00:29:30-00:29:31] Yeah.
[00:29:31-00:29:33] And then having gas leaks in the future.
[00:29:33-00:29:34] Yeah.
[00:29:34-00:29:35] So how about this?
[00:29:35-00:29:38] Let me bring the estimates down to just two of them.
[00:29:38-00:29:40] I'll just eliminate this one.
[00:29:40-00:29:41] Yeah.
[00:29:41-00:29:42] Eliminate that one.
[00:29:42-00:29:43] Yeah.
[00:29:43-00:29:45] And the only thing, I just want to make sure it's clear.
[00:29:45-00:29:46] Sure.
[00:29:46-00:29:52] On my end, it would be so much easier if I didn't have to charge for the repair today.
[00:29:52-00:29:57] And if we actually just basically considered it as a complimentary thing for you.
[00:29:57-00:30:06] So if we did feel comfortable with signing, what that would just look like on your end
[00:30:06-00:30:09] would just be a $1,000 down payment.
[00:30:09-00:30:15] The other thing is we can see what options you qualify for in regards to financing.
[00:30:15-00:30:20] And if that's the case, if we have financing, then I don't even need a down payment today.
[00:30:20-00:30:23] We would just do just the financing side of it.
[00:30:23-00:30:29] And we do come with a, every contractor that's reputable comes with this guarantee here.
[00:30:29-00:30:33] So as you're talking to your wife, anything weird comes up.
[00:30:33-00:30:35] We even have this notice right here.
[00:30:35-00:30:38] So we always have a reputable three day right to cancel.
[00:30:38-00:30:39] Yeah.
[00:30:39-00:30:40] No, we won't do that today.
[00:30:40-00:30:41] Okay.
[00:30:41-00:30:42] Sure.
[00:30:42-00:30:46] Just send me the, I'll talk to her and then we'll make a decision.
[00:30:46-00:30:47] Absolutely.
[00:30:47-00:30:50] Within 15 days, I will completely credit that back towards it.
[00:30:50-00:30:51] Okay.
[00:30:51-00:30:54] So I'm going to have pretty good estimates up a little bit more.
[00:30:54-00:30:55] Okay.
[00:30:55-00:31:00] And I'll include the duct sealing promotion.
[00:31:00-00:31:07] And because tech is needing a Hearst test, we actually just kind of have to do that anyways.
[00:31:07-00:31:10] So I'm going to modify it a little bit.
[00:31:10-00:31:14] And what you'll see that's new when I send it to you is permit and Hearst test.
[00:31:14-00:31:17] You'll see a duct seal cost.
[00:31:17-00:31:24] But then if you keep scrolling down, you would see a credit it back as a promotion.
[00:31:24-00:31:25] Okay.
[00:31:25-00:31:26] So great.
[00:31:26-00:31:35] We'll go ahead, eliminate both of the gas options and we'll stay with the Bryant and the
[00:31:35-00:31:36] Bosch.
[00:31:36-00:31:37] Yes.
[00:31:37-00:31:41] And very cool.
[00:31:41-00:31:47] And let me go ahead and get the $1,000 for today.
[00:31:47-00:31:48] $1,009.
[00:31:48-00:31:50] So do you need a Visa or Mastercard?
[00:31:50-00:31:51] Yeah.
[00:31:51-00:31:52] Let me see.
[00:31:52-00:31:53] What is it?
[00:31:53-00:31:58] I think it's a Mastercard.
[00:31:58-00:32:04] If I can find it.
[00:32:04-00:32:05] Always important.
[00:32:05-00:32:06] Okay.
[00:32:06-00:32:07] There you go.
[00:32:07-00:32:08] Great.
[00:32:08-00:32:15] I'm going to send it back.
